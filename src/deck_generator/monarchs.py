    recorded end year is not itself an accession year, that end year — i.e. the throne
    did not pass directly to a successor that year. This captures a dynasty's final
    year (the last ruler, with no successor) and the start of an interregnum (a gap
    before the next accession), as well as Wikidata coronation-lag (a successor's
    recorded accession a few years after the predecessor's death, e.g. Æthelstan 927
    vs Edward the Elder's death in 924). Continuous same-year successions add nothing.

    ``add_transition_years`` / ``drop_transition_years`` are manual corrections for
    Wikidata's one-statement-per-ruler model, mirroring the award pipeline's
    ``manual_entries`` / ``exclude_entries``. Add covers transitions Wikidata omits —
    a brief deposition and restoration recorded as one unbroken reign (e.g. al-Muqtadir
    deposed for al-Qahir in 929). Drop covers dating artifacts (e.g. Wikidata ends
    al-Musta'in in 865, but he reigned until his 866 deposition). Drop removes every
    occurrence of a year and is applied before add.

    Add is IDEMPOTENT: a year already present is not appended again. Corrections are bets that
    Wikidata stays wrong, and Wikidata improves; an unconditional append would silently double
    a digit the day upstream fixed the underlying statement. Use `stale_corrections` to find
    corrections that have become no-ops.
